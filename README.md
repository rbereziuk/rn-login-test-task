# Test task

- You need to create a login form for the user
- Use react query and TS in the project

Create a login form for the user:

- [x] The user should go from the Home screen to the Login screen
- [x] The user enters the username and password on the Login screen
- [ ] If the username or password is invalid, display an error
- [ ] If username and password are valid, redirect to the Profile screen
- [ ] On the Profile screen, show the user's data from the API
- [ ] Only authorized users can go to the Profile screen
- [ ] If the user clicks on the Logout button, we have to unlog the user and redirect to Home
- [ ] If the user is not logged in or the token is invalid, we automatically redirect to Home from the Profile screen. That is, for example, if a user is on the Profile screen and their session suddenly becomes invalid, app should automatically log out
